Matrix Multiplication

•	Situation: Need to enhance efficiency in matrix multiplication for large-scale computations using concurrent programming.

•	Task: Create a C# program for matrix multiplication employing parallel processing and user-defined degrees of parallelism, while measuring performance.

•	Action: Developed a program that reads and parses matrices from files, performs multiplication using concurrent techniques, and measures processing time. The program also handles exceptions related to file errors and invalid operations.

•	Result: Achieved optimized performance in matrix multiplication, ensuring accurate results, effective error handling, and demonstrating robust parallel processing capabilities.
